    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) is one among the numerous [Deep Learning frameworks](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/python-deep-learning-frameworks-overview.html) which allows us to build powerful Deep Learning models by harnessing GPU compute. PyTorch is extensively used for rapid prototyping in research and small scale projects. The objective of this article is to give you a hands on experience with PyTorch & some basic mathematical lingo associated with Deep Learning. We also introduce the classic problem of [Handwritten Digit Recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).\n",

    "PyTorch is a Python based scientific computing package targeted at two sets of audiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Deep Learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed through Dynamic Compute graphs & Imperative Programming control flow.\n",
    "- A replacement for NumPy to harness GPU compute capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a list of modules we'll need in order to run this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [torch.autograd](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/autograd.html) Provides classes and functions implementing automatic differentiation of arbitrary scalar valued functions.\n",
    "2. [torch.nn](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) Package provides an easy and modular way to build and train simple or complex neural networks.\n",
    "3. [torchvision](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/index.html) consists of popular datasets, model architectures & common image transformations.\n",
    "4. [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.\n",

Be it an images stored in the form of `[height x width]` matrices, a piece of text stored in the form a vector or some spooky operation taking place between those two. PyTorch provides us with objects known as Tensors that store all this data under one roof.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Formally*, a [PyTorch Tensor](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/tensors.html) is conceptually identical to a NumPy's `ndarray`, and PyTorch provides many functions for operating on these Tensors. Like standard `ndarrays`, PyTorch Tensors do not know anything about deep learning or computational graphs or gradients; they are a generic tool for scientific computing. We can use n-dimensional Tensors to our requirement, for instance - we can have multidimensional (2D) tensor storing an image, or a single variable storing text.\n",

Furthermore, this makes debugging much easier. You'll see some more virtues of dynamic compute graphs in the upcoming articles.\n",

With a static graph the loop construct needs to be a part of the graph; for this reason TensorFlow provides operators such as tf.scan for embedding loops into the graph.

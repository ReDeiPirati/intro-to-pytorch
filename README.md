# FloydHub Introduction to Deep Learning mini series

This Mini Series covers the basic of Deep Learning guiding the user in a learn by experiments journey. This series is split in 4 Episode of increasing difficulties:

- [Beginner](beginner/)
- [Intermediate](intermediate/)
- [Advance](advance/)
- [Research](research/)

## Beginner
The beginner episode is split in 4 part:
- [**FloydHub introducting to Deep Learning**](beginner/0.FH-intro-to-DL/)covers an high level overview what is DL, why it is become mainstream, what are the current challenges and in which direction researchers are looking for.
- [**FH intro to DL: PyTorch**](beginner/1.PyTorch/) covers the PyTorch Deep Learning Framework.
- [**FH intro to DL: Linear Regression**](beginner/2.Linear-Regression/) covers the ML workflow and the classical house prediction regression problem solved with a Linear Regression model.
- [**FH intro to DL: Logistic Regression**](beginner/3.Logistic-Regression/) covers the MNIST dataset and the Logistic Regression model to classify it. This end the overview of the basic building blocks which allow us to go deeper.
